  <h4> Home and business fires are a reality. Every year, an estimated 15,400 buildings
      are damaged by fire. While no one ever anticipates a fire occurring in their building,
      it is always best to err on the side of caution. Proper implementation of a fireproofing system can protect the structure from fire,
      allowing occupants to exit safely and saving millions in reconstruction costs.</h4>
