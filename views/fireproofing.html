    <p>Home and business fires are a reality. Every year, an estimated 15,400 buildings
 are damaged by fire. While no one ever anticipates a fire occurring in their building,
  it is always best to err on the side of caution. Proper implementation of a fireproofing system can protect the structure from fire,
  allowing occupants to exit safely and saving millions in reconstruction costs.</p>
